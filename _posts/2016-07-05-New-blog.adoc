= New blog
:published_at: 2016-07-05


I got a new blog up and running now... I wont update it too much... Maybe a few times a week to say where I've been and such. I could integrate it into my Adobe Portfolio website so maybe I'll do that!

For the time being I hope my problems with the domain and HSTS will get solved and that I get a better future... In the mean time I hope you're gonna have a great day too!

Edit: Fixed the error by clearing ALL my browser data... Luckily I could save my passwords... x3
Edit2: Maybe not all :(

If you're wondering about the URL it's because I'm hosting it on my Cozy Cloud provided by http://cozy.io you should check them out yourselves if you're interested in getting a personal cloud filled with features that other users have created!
