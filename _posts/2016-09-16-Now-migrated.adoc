= Now migrated!


Finally I got propper blog hosting! Now I use HubPress (https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io) 

It feels limited in what it can do. Especially in the writing. BUT unlike other GitHub Pages hostable, it has web based writing... You can write the text in your browser. I think it's a wrapper to ghost which is really nice actually! I can't turn text into links but I have to post them seperatly which kinda sucks.

== Titles

=== Great

Instead of using headers like in HTML you use '='.

I can also insert code snipets

I quite like this.


Hopefully writing will be easier in the future and maybe even more entries to come!

Edit: I think I'll try out a few more of the editing things you can do in the text editor.

*So this is bold*

_This is italic_

`This is "monospace"` Which is like the the code snpipet thingy but single line and stuff.

TIP: This is a test

WARNING: This is another test

You can also use the `+` sign to add a +
line break

The more I learn about this writing style the more I like it!

Hopefully I can put more emphasis on the text in the future.
